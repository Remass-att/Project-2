Aspects of Node.js:

1. Event-driven, non-blocking I/O model
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which allows it to handle multiple requests concurrently without blocking the execution of other requests. This approach enables Node.js to handle a large number of connections with minimal overhead.
How it works:
- Node.js registers an event handler for a request.
- When the request is completed, the event handler is triggered.
- Node.js continues to process other requests while waiting for the completion of the previous request.
Benefits:
- High concurrency: Node.js can handle a large number of connections concurrently.
- Efficient resource utilization: Node.js minimizes the overhead of thread creation and context switching.
- Fast response times: Node.js can respond quickly to requests, even under high load.

2. Single-threaded event loop architecture

Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop architecture, which allows it to handle multiple requests using a single thread. This approach eliminates the need for thread synchronization and reduces the overhead of context switching.
How it works:
- Node.js uses a single thread to handle all requests.
- The event loop processes events and callbacks in a non-blocking manner.
- Node.js uses libuv, a cross-platform library, to handle I/O operations.

Node.js handles concurrent connections using its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. When a request is made, Node.js registers an event handler for the request and continues to process other requests. When the request is completed, the event handler is triggered, and the response is sent to the client.
How it works:
- Node.js uses a single thread to handle all requests.
- When a request is made, Node.js registers an event handler for the request.
- Node.js continues to process other requests while waiting for the completion of the previous request.
