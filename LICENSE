Aspects of Node.js:

1. Event-driven, non-blocking I/O model
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which allows it to handle multiple requests concurrently without blocking the execution of other requests. This approach enables Node.js to handle a large number of connections with minimal overhead.
How it works:
- Node.js registers an event handler for a request.

- Node.js continues to process other requests while waiting for the completion of the previous request.
Benefits:
- High concurrency: Node.js can handle a large number of connections concurrently.
- Efficient resource utilization: Node.js minimizes the overhead of thread creation and context switching.
- Fast response times: Node.js can respond quickly to requests, even under high load.

2. Single-threaded event loop architecture

Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop architecture, which allows it to handle multiple requests using a single thread. This approach eliminates the need for thread synchronization and reduces the overhead of context switching.
How it works:
- Node.js uses a single thread to handle all requests.
- The event loop processes events and callbacks in a non-blocking manner.
- Node.js uses libuv, a cross-platform library, to handle I/O operations.
